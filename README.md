# FAQ

## What is patcher.xyz?

This project solves the problem of transcribing and sharing patch notes to save them or simply to send them to someone. No more typing!

## What can I do?

The patch builder allows connecting CV inputs and CV outputs in an easy and fast way.

You can then share the URL or save the list of connections as text. Patches are saved on the website itself and can be shared in with a simple link.

#### But doesn't this require having a list of all modules and their information?

\
Yes, however, we are not starting from scratch!&#x20;

Since one of the objectives is to maintain a database of inputs and outputs of each module, we ask for the help of the community to map all modules' CVs. We already have a lot of data mapped and ready.

## Great! How i can help?

We are currently making the first public announcements of this idea and collecting some initial feedback from testers so I would like to know what you think about this idea and if you are interested in the project.

If you want to stay updated on the progress of development the best way is to subscribe to the discord channel that is the central communication hub.
