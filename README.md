## What is patcher.xyz?

This project solves the problem of transcribing and sharing patch notes to save them or simply to send them to someone. No more typing!

\
Patches are built by clicking the INs and OUTs of modules added to your collection in the "Patch Builder". You can then see the signal flow in our unique graph visualizer\


\
Similarly to modulargrid, we also have a rack builder that can sort modules while dragging and dropping.&#x20;

## What can I do?

The patch builder allows connecting CV inputs and CV outputs in an easy and fast way.

You can then share the URL or save the list of connections as text. Patches are saved on the website itself and can be shared in with a simple link.

#### But doesn't this require having a list of all modules and their information?

\
Yes, however, we are not starting from scratch!&#x20;

Since one of the objectives is to maintain a database of inputs and outputs of each module, we ask for the help of the community to map all modules' CVs. We already have a lot of data mapped and ready.

## Great! How i can help?

The first public announcements of this idea are being made and initial feedback is being collected. Please let us know your thoughts on this and what you would like to see improved.

The best way to stay informed about development is to subscribe to the discord channel, which is the central communication hub.
