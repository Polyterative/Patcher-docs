# Quick Start

Welcome to the Quick Start guide for Patcher. This guide will help you get started with using Patcher and provide you with the necessary information to navigate through the documentation.

## Getting Started

To begin, make sure you have a basic understanding of the Patcher concepts. If you are new to Patcher, we recommend starting with the [Modules](../learn-patcher.xyz/modules.md) section to learn about the different modules available.

## Collection

The **Collection** section in Patcher allows you to manage your modules and create patches. If you are not familiar with the Collection section, we suggest reading the [Collection](../learn-patcher.xyz/collection.md) documentation.

## Creating a Patch

To create a patch, follow the steps outlined in the [Create Patch](../learn-patcher.xyz/patches.md#creating-a-patch) section. This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to create a patch in Patcher.

## INs and OUTs

When adding connections to a patch, it is important to understand the concept of INs and OUTs. For more information on INs and OUTs, refer to the [Adding Connections to a Patch](../learn-patcher.xyz/patches.md#adding-connections) section.

That's it! You now have a basic understanding of Patcher and how to get started. If you have any further questions, feel free to refer to the rest of the documentation or reach out to our support team.
