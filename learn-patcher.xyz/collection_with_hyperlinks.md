# Collection with Hyperlinks

The "Collection" section in Patcher allows users to manage their modules and create patches. Here's how you can use the "Collection" section:

1. **Account Creation and Login:** If you don't have an account, click on the "Sign Up" button on the homepage to create one. After creating an account, sign in to access your dashboard.

2. **Navigate to Collection:** Once signed in, go to the "Collection" section. You can find this option at the top right corner of your dashboard.

3. **Adding Modules:** In the "Collection" section, you can add modules to your collection. Navigate to the [Modules](../modules.md) section and select the modules you want to add.

4. **Creating a Patch:** After adding modules to your collection, you can create a new patch. Click on the [Create Patch](../patches.md#creating-a-patch) option to start crafting your patch.

5. **Editing a Patch:** Editing a patch is as easy as creating one. Refer to the "Editing a patch" section in the [Patches](../patches.md) documentation for a step-by-step guide.

6. **Adding Connections:** To add connections to a patch, follow the steps outlined in the "Adding Connections to a Patch" section in the [Patches](../patches.md) documentation.

7. **Removing Connections:** If you need to remove connections from a patch, refer to the "Removing Connections from a Patch" section in the [Patches](../patches.md) documentation for detailed instructions.
