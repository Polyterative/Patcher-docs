## Add connections to a patch

Adding connections to a patch involves a few more steps. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create a patch:** Start by creating a new patch. If you're not sure how to do this, refer to the 'Creating a patch' section above.

2. **Add modules to collection:** Once you have a patch, you can start adding modules to it. Navigate to your collection and select the modules you want to add.

3. **Verify that modules already have tracked INs and OUTs (add if missing):** After adding the modules, make sure they have tracked INs and OUTs. If they don't, you'll need to add them.

4. **Click on the INs and OUTs to select a connection:** Once the modules have tracked INs and OUTs, you can start making connections. Click on the INs and OUTs to select a connection.

5. **Confirm connection:** After selecting a connection, confirm it to add it to the patch.

6. **Save patch:** Once you're done adding connections, don't forget to save your patch.

1. **Open a patch:** Start by opening the patch from which you want to remove connections.

2. **Look at the list of connections:** Once the patch is open, look at the list of connections.

3. **Click on the button to remove:** Find the connection you want to remove and click on the 'Remove' button.

4. **Save:** After removing the connections, make sure to save your changes.
