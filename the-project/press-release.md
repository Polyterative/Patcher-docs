After a decade of stagnation in this space we are excited to present patcher.xyz: the modern way to manage everything modular.

It’s a tool for professionals, enthusiasts, and casual wigglers.

Novadays artists must develop their own means of taking notes, often on paper, since there is no common format for sharing ideas. Although there is nothing wrong with that, we believe we have found a better way.

We wanted our patch ideas to be searchable, editable and easily-shareable. We needed an easier way to plan our racks, without creating a mess. We needed to be able to find awesome modules fitting our style and feel, without being lost in the ocean of different options. We made it a reality.

Patcher.xyz was built to provide a fast and enjoyable experience while bypassing the limitations of current offerings. Our vision is to build a platform to assist you in any part of your wiggling experience: from research, to planning, to buying or trading gear, to sharing your new ideas and music.
