![Patcher Promo Image](../.gitbook/assets/patcher\_promo\_4.png)

Patcher.xyz is a platform designed to simplify the process of transcribing and sharing patch notes. It allows users to build patches by clicking the INs and OUTs of modules in the "Patch Builder", visualize the signal flow, and share or save the patches with ease. It also features a rack builder for sorting modules.

## Usage

### What can I do with the patch builder?

The patch builder is a versatile tool that allows you to connect CV inputs and CV outputs quickly and easily. For instance, you can create a complex signal flow by connecting multiple modules, visualize it in our unique graph visualizer, and then share the URL or save the list of connections as text. All patches are saved on the website and can be shared with a simple link.

### Do I need a list of all modules and their information to use the patch builder?

Yes, but don't worry! We already have a substantial database of inputs and outputs for each module, thanks to the contributions of our community. We're always looking for more help to map all modules' CVs.
