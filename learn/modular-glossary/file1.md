# Modular Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for terms used in the modular programming paradigm.

## Module

A module is a self-contained piece of a system with its own namespace and API.

## Component

A component is a reusable module that can be combined with other components to build complex systems.

## Dependency

A dependency is a module or component that a system relies on to function correctly.

## Interface

An interface is a contract that defines how modules or components can interact with each other.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal details of a module or component, exposing only what is necessary for other modules or components to interact with it.

## Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable modules or components.

## Composition

Composition is the process of building complex systems by combining simpler modules or components.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one module or component to inherit the properties and methods of another module or component.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of a module or component to take on many forms, depending on the context in which it is used.
